# Aim of the workshop

The workshop aims at the promotion of technical and scientific exchange between industry, academia and authorities in the fields of autonomous waterway transporta-tion, smart waterborne intermodal logistics and related subjects. The proposers have invited several experts in the field (see below) for giving a talk about their recent re-search achievement and innovative projects in these fields. 	

# Outline

The objective of workshop is the presentation and discussion of the latest advances in waterborne intelligent and automated systems. The workshop is an important platform within the ITS community, focusing on key issues in the development of autonomous vessels, such as advanced assistance systems, modelling and simulation, digital test field waterway, navigation, control concepts and automation of cargo handling. By focusing on these areas, the workshop aims to drive innovation, improve efficiency and enhance safety in waterborne transport, thus making a significant impact in the field of ITS. Renowned experts in the field will present their latest research and devel-opments during the event, providing participants with valuable insights and updates on the latest breakthroughs.

# Format and schedule

The workshop will be opened by an introductory talk of 10-15 minutes by Dr. Lahbib Zentari (BAW), followed by talks of 20-30 minutes given by invited experts. The workshop will conclude with a panel discussion of 30-45 minutes, which will also encourage a more intensive exchange between the speakers and the audience than it is possible during the short Q&A session after each presentation. 

A detailed schedule of the workshop will be published shortly.

### [Nicola Forti](https://nicolaforti.com/)
Nicola holds a Ph.D. in Information Engineering and is currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Florence, Italy. His research interests span control theory, state estima-tion, sensor networks, data fusion, statistical signal processing, artificial intelligence, and data-driven modelling, with a focus on applications in cyber-physical systems, large-scale systems, and autonomous technologies. He has held prestigious research positions such as Visiting Scholar at Carnegie Mellon University and Researcher at the NATO Science & Technology Organisation - Centre for Maritime Research and Exper-imentation. His research addresses critical aspects of maritime surveillance and au-tonomous shipping, including maritime situational awareness, anomaly detection and navigation. His publication record reflects his commitment to using cutting-edge technologies to enhance maritime safety, security and sustainability. 
Planned topic of talk: TBC

### Lars Grundhöfer
Lars is currently working as a researcher for the German Aerospace Center, Institute of Communications and Navigation. He received his master’s degree in electrical engi-neering from the Hamburg University of Technology, Germany. His research primarily focuses on the development and enhancement of terrestrial navigation systems, par-ticularly the medium-frequency R-Mode system, which serves as a backup to Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). His work addresses the accuracy and reliability of position, navigation, and timing information in maritime contexts, especially when GNSS is unavailable or unreliable. He also explores the integration of terrestrial naviga-tion with other systems, like low-cost software-defined radios and hybrid GNSS-terrestrial localization methods, aiming to enhance overall maritime navigation safety and reliability.
Planned topic of talk: The Medium Frequency R-Mode Test Bed in Canada

### Paul Koch
Paul is a researcher at the Fraunhofer Center for Maritime Logistics and Services (CML), Germany.  His research primarily focuses on enhancing situational awareness and collision avoidance for maritime autonomous surface ships through systems com-pliant with the Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs). He also contributes to developing standards for evaluating and certi-fying AI-based decision-making systems for autonomous vessels. Through these areas of research, Paul significantly contributes to advancing the capabilities and safety of autonomous maritime systems and the broader adoption of AI technologies in the maritime industry.

### [Hanna Krasowski](https://hanna.krasowski.io/)
Hanna is in the final stages of completing her Ph.D. at the Cyber-Physical Systems Group at the Technical University of Munich, Germany. Starting in June, she will join the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, as a postdoctoral researcher. Her work combines the flexibility of reinforcement learning with the reliable guarantees of formal methods. In her re-search, she also addresses the challenges of compliance with marine traffic rules and the integration of safety measures in autonomous shipping technologies. Hanna con-ducts experiments on various motion planning scenarios, including those involving marine vessels. She is the principal developer of the CommonOcean Benchmarking Software, which provides researchers with tools for evaluating and comparing their maritime motion planners. Despite being early in her career, she has supervised sever-al theses and authored multiple publications on topics such as safe reinforcement learning, motion planning, and formal methods for autonomous vessels. 

### Tim Reuscher
Tim is a researcher and head of Mobility and Navigation Solutions at the Institute of Automatic Control at RWTH Aachen University, Germany, specializes in trajectory planning, tracking, vehicle control and multi-sensor fusion-based localization. His re-search in the field of shipping focuses on developing advanced control methodolo-gies for autonomous vessels and ferries, particularly in challenging environments. Tim has contributed to projects like FernBin and AutoFerry, which aim to enhance the au-tomation of inland vessels and ferries. These projects address issues such as robust nav-igation, efficient path planning, and obstacle avoidance in confined waterways and coastal environments, aiming to improve safety and operational efficiency in mari-time transport.

### Lahbib Zentari (keynote)
Lahbib is currently a researcher in the Shipping Department of BAW. He holds a mas-ter's degree in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering from the Bremen University of Applied Sciences in Germany and a Ph.D. in Computational Fluid Dynamics from the UDE. His main areas of research are experimental and computational fluid dynam-ics applied to manoeuvring problems in extremely confined waters. In this context, he is responsible for the development of manoeuvring simulation tools, which are widely used in nautical studies at BAW. Furthermore, his research has found new applications in the development of simulation environments for autonomous vessels. He has pub-lished several papers in the field of extreme shallow water manoeuvring.
Planned topic of talk: AI application for a virtual test environment on an inland ship handling simulator
